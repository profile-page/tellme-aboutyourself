# tellme-aboutyourself

<b>First personal site project </b>

Things I want to convey on this site: 

- Show your personality
- Display projects you've worked on, or currently working on 
   -     snapshots to projects and links to Glitch or to Code on GitHub
 - Contact form linked to personal connections (LinkedIn, Email, etch)
